# Work Day Scheduler 

## Powered by:
* BOOTSTRAP
* HTML
* CSS 
* JQUERY
* THIRD PARTY API
* JAVASCRIPT

## Requirements and tasks for this projects
* My task in this project is to build/create a simple calendar application using Bootstrap and Jquery. So I layout the page template using bootstrap properties.
* This application should be a user friendly powered by jquery. So, I created functions that allow user to key in events of their past, present and future schedule.
* The page should also have a current time displayed on to, so I used moments.js to get the current time.
* The user key in events should also be save in the text input even after refreshing the page. So, I create a local storage to get all user inputs.
* The application should also have a color-coding that will indicate whether the schedule is current, past or in the future. So I used Css to assign colors as a markdown on the color schedule.
